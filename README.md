# vscode-env-plugins

This is my personal list of VSCode extensions used to setup various types of projects.

Disable all plugins in your IDE and enable only those specified with your `.vscode/extension.json` file when you open your project. It should contains only extensions related to your current development environment instead of hundreds (slow IDE, overlapped functionality of styling plugins, etc.). Further maintain your project's `extensions.json` as your project evolves and version it in GIT to help your colleagues with quick project setup.
